//! `loam-app`: thin App trait + event-loop runner that extracts the winit
//! boilerplate every Loam example would otherwise rewrite.
//!
//! Apps implement [`App`] on a struct that owns their state; the runner [`run`]
//! (or [`run_with_config`]) handles window creation, [`RenderDevice`] +
//! surface-error recovery, [`ShaderDb`]/[`AssetWatcher`] hot-reload,
//! [`InputState`] routing, [`FixedTimestep`]-driven `App::tick`, and FPS/title
//! bookkeeping. It is not an ECS, scene graph, render-graph orchestrator, or
//! camera framework; apps own those directly.
//!
//! A frame-capture pipeline ships behind the `capture` feature (default-on); see
//! [`capture`]. External recorders (OBS) remain better for long sessions.
