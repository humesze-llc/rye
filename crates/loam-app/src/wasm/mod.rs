//! Wasm32-only support code. Subdivided as the worker-mode plumbing grew
//! beyond what a single file could hold.
//!
//! - [`launch`]: click-to-start container + the original page-startup
//!   helpers (`is_manual_mode`, `wait_for_launch`).
//! - [`worker`]: OffscreenCanvas + Web Worker mode for GC-isolated rendering.
//!   The main thread owns the DOM and forwards input via postMessage; the
//!   worker owns wgpu + egui and drives RAF. Avoids main-thread GC pauses and
//!   sidesteps winit's incomplete worker-context support.
//!
//! Detection helpers ([`is_worker_context`], plus the heap sampler that
//! `loam-time::frame_trace` registers) live at the module root so the
//! `loam_app::wasm::*` import path stays flat for the common cases.
//!
//! ## Browser support
//!
//! Verified on Chrome and Firefox (desktop). The hard requirements are
//! WebGPU (`navigator.gpu`), `OffscreenCanvas` + `transferControlToOffscreen`,
//! and ES-module workers (`new Worker(url, { type: "module" })`). Safari is
//! UNVERIFIED: WebGPU shipped in Safari 18 but the OffscreenCanvas-in-worker
//! + module-worker combination this path depends on has not been tested here,
//! and older Safari lacks WebGPU entirely. Demos that need a Safari fallback
//! should feature-detect `navigator.gpu` and surface a "WebGPU required"
//! message rather than spawning the worker into a hard failure.
