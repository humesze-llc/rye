//! The [`Space`] trait, Loam's interface to geometry.
//!
//! A `Space` is a Riemannian manifold: a metric and its Levi-Civita
//! connection. Isometries are a separate contract on [`IsometryGroup`],
//! because a Space need not have any. The GPU-facing half of the contract
//! lives on [`WgslSpace`].
//!
//! Methods take `&self` so parametric geometries (curvature scalar, radius) can
//! store their parameter; stateless ones monomorphize to direct calls.
//!
//! `Self::Vector` is a tangent vector at *some* point; the trait does not track
//! which. Prefer [`crate::Tangent`] outside tight kernels, it bundles the base
//! point with the vector.
