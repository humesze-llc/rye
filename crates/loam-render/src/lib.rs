//! Thin wgpu wrapper plus a tiny render-graph harness.
//!
//! - [`device`]: window surface + adapter/device acquisition. One [`device::RenderDevice`]
//!   per app.
//! - [`graph`]: linear list of [`graph::RenderNode`]s executed in order against a
//!   [`wgpu::TextureView`].
//! - [`lattice`]: pixel-space layout primitive ([`Viewport`]) for restricting a render
//!   node to a sub-region of the framebuffer (e.g. carving out an egui side-panel area).
//! - [`hypergimbal`]: the six SO(4) rotation planes as grabbable rings, from the
//!   stereographic 16-cell projection; ring geometry, picking, and the drag-to-rotor map.
//! - [`raymarch`]: ready-made fullscreen-triangle ray-march nodes (Euclidean, geodesic,
//!   hyperslice 4D); the engine's main render path until rasterised geometry shows up.
//!
//! The crate stays deliberately small: it hands wgpu primitives to callers rather than
//! abstracting them behind a higher-level engine API.

/// How a rasterizer pipeline interacts with depth. Three states only -- avoids the

/// have. Shared by [`LineRasterNode`] and [`TriangleRasterNode`].
///
/// - [`DepthMode::Off`]: no depth attachment; passes draw on top in submission order.
///   Useful for HUD-style overlays where occlusion doesn't matter.
/// - [`DepthMode::ReadWrite`]: standard scene-geometry mode. Per-fragment `depth_compare:
///   Less` + depth-write enabled; this is how lines and filled triangles behave in
///   normal 3D rendering.
/// - [`DepthMode::ReadOnly`]: depth-test against the existing buffer but don't write to
///   it. Used for alpha-blended overlays that should be occluded by scene geometry
///   in front of them without burying subsequent draws behind them in depth.
