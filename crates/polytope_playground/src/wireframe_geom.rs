/// `a` / `b` are the body-local 4D endpoints and `arc_center` is the centre of
/// the circumsphere they sit on, in that same frame. Both curves share the
/// endpoints (the vertices sit on the circumsphere), so the morph only bows the
/// interior onto the sphere. `blend == 0` renders the R3 chord between projected
/// endpoints (under stereographic, a comparison overlay; the faithful arc is
/// `blend == 1`); `blend > 0` subdivides into [`SPACE_TESSELLATION_SAMPLES`]
/// with a per-sample chord/arc blend and a linear color gradient.
/// `slerp_scratch` is a caller-owned reused buffer, cleared on entry.
///
/// An off-centre body frame is HANDLED, not refused: the arc is taken about
/// `arc_center` and carried back, so a body a hull contact has pushed off the
/// `w = 0` slice (whose frame then carries
/// [`crate::physics::BodyPose::body_local`]'s `w` offset) bows onto the
/// circumsphere it is actually on. Reading `a.length()` as the circumradius
/// instead bows onto a sphere through the frame origin, which the body's
/// vertices stop sharing the moment `position.w` is nonzero. Pass `Vec4::ZERO`
/// for an origin-centred frame, where the two forms agree.
///
/// Each sample is a direct `flat.lerp(sphere, blend)` in ambient R⁴, not a
/// metric (`BlendedSpace::exp_target`) geodesic. The wireframe only needs the
/// visual chord-to-arc bow, which the lerp delivers bit-deterministically and
/// far cheaper than per-sample RK4 integration; this runs over every edge of
/// the 600-cell each frame (the dominant per-frame cost). Shared endpoints mean
/// no visible fidelity is lost.
