//! `rye-asset`: filesystem watching and hot-reload events for Rye.
//!
//! The core type is [`AssetWatcher`]. Downstream crates (currently
//! `rye-shader`, eventually meshes / textures / scripts) poll it each
//! frame and invalidate their caches on the returned events.
//!
//! The watcher is deliberately minimal: no asset loading, no
//! type-specific handling, no ID indirection. It just tells you which
//! paths changed. Consumers decide what "changed" means for them.
