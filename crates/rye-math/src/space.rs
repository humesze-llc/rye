//! The [`Space`] trait — Rye's interface to geometry.
//!
//! A `Space` is a Riemannian manifold equipped with an isometry group.
//! Every concrete geometry (Euclidean R³, hyperbolic H³, spherical S³,
//! Euclidean R⁴, …) implements this trait, and every other system in the
//! engine that needs to know *what space means* takes `S: Space` as a
//! generic.
//!
//! The GPU-facing half of the contract lives on [`WgslSpace`], a separate
//! subtrait — see its docs for the rationale.
//!
//! ## Why methods take `&self`
//!
//! Stateless geometries like [`crate::EuclideanR3`] carry no data and
//! monomorphize to direct calls. Parametric geometries — hyperbolic with a
//! curvature scalar, spherical with a radius — need somewhere to store
//! that parameter. `&self` gives them that without forcing stateless impls
//! to pay a runtime cost.
//!
//! ## Tangent vectors carry an implicit base point
//!
//! `Self::Vector` is a tangent vector at *some* point on the manifold; the
//! trait does not enforce *which* point. Callers tracking tangent vectors
//! outside tight numerical kernels should prefer [`crate::Tangent`], which
//! bundles the base point with the vector and exposes safe transport /
//! exponential / scale helpers.
