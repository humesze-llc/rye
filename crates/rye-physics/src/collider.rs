//! Collider types. Re-exports from [`rye_shape`], `Collider` is
//! just an alias for the canonical [`rye_shape::Shape`] enum, and
//! `ColliderKind` aliases [`rye_shape::ShapeKind`]. This is the
//! consolidation that resolves the "`rye-sdf::PrimitiveKind` and
//! `rye-physics::Collider` are parallel hierarchies that must be
//! kept in sync by hand" duplication.
//!
//! New collider types are added by:
//! 1. Adding a variant to [`rye_shape::Shape`] and
//!    [`rye_shape::ShapeKind`].
//! 2. Registering narrowphase functions in
//!    [`crate::Narrowphase::register`] for the new [`ColliderKind`].
//!
//! The `Collider::Sphere` variant carries an extra `center: Vec3`
//! field that's unused by physics (the body's position is the
//! center). Construct physics spheres via
//! [`rye_shape::Shape::sphere_at_origin`] or pattern-match with
//! `Shape::Sphere { radius, .. }` to ignore it.
