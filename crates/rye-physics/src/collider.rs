//! Collider shapes.
//!
//! The variants of [`Collider`] are space-agnostic data — just the raw
//! shape parameters. Their *behavior* under a given space lives in
//! narrowphase functions registered with [`crate::Narrowphase`].
//!
//! New collider types are added by:
//! 1. Adding a variant here.
//! 2. Adding a [`ColliderKind`] discriminant.
//! 3. Registering narrowphase functions in `Narrowphase::register(kind_a,
//!    kind_b, fn)`.
//!
//! Nothing in the solver or `World` changes.
