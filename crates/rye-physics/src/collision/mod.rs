//! Space-agnostic collision algorithms shared across Euclidean
//! narrowphases.
//!
//! - [`vector_ops`]: the vector-algebra trait shared between 3D and
//!   4D (and beyond), keeping GJK and most of EPA dimension-generic.
//! - [`gjk`] / [`gjk_r4`]: Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi containment test
//!   for convex shapes via their Minkowski difference. Used for
//!   polytope-polytope narrowphase where analytical solutions
//!   (sphere-sphere, sphere-halfspace) don't apply.
//! - [`epa`] / [`epa_r4`]: Expanding Polytope Algorithm for
//!   penetration depth and contact normal from a GJK-terminating
//!   simplex.
//! - [`simplex_r4`]: closest-point-on-simplex via Gram-matrix
//!   projection, the dimension-agnostic 4D simplex helper.
//!
//! The persistent contact cache lives in `crate::manifold`, not
//! here, because it depends on `PhysicsSpace` (S::Vector, etc.) and
//! these algorithms are deliberately Space-free.
