//! Persistent contact manifolds and the projected Gauss-Seidel
//! constraint solver primitives.
//!
//! ## Why persistence
//!
//! Single-contact, single-pass impulse resolution can't keep a stack of
//! bodies stable: the bottom body has one contact with the floor, one
//! with the body above; each frame's resolution applies an impulse,
//! the next frame finds the bodies still slightly overlapping (due to
//! gravity over `dt`), repeat -> jitter forever.
//!
//! The standard fix is two-fold:
//!
//! 1. **Persistent manifolds.** Cache up to 4 contact points per pair
//!    across frames so the solver sees the same constraint repeatedly
//!    rather than rediscovering it.
//! 2. **Warm-starting.** At the start of each step, re-apply each
//!    cached point's previous-frame accumulated impulse. Bodies start
//!    near their settled velocities, so the iterative solver converges
//!    in a handful of iterations instead of dozens.
//!
//! ## Scope of this first cut
//!
//! - Contact-to-slot matching is by **world-space proximity** (cheap,
//!   adequate when bodies barely move per frame, which is the
//!   stacking-demo case). A future revision can switch to local-frame
//!   matching for fast-rotating bodies.
//! - Up to 4 contact slots per manifold; replacement policy when full
//!   evicts the slot with smallest accumulated total impulse.
//! - Manifolds are keyed by `(body_a, body_b)` with `body_a < body_b`.
//!   This breaks if bodies are removed mid-simulation; not an issue
//!   today since neither demo removes bodies.
