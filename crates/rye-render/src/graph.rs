//! Linear render-graph harness. Owns a [`Vec<Box<dyn RenderNode>>`]
//! and runs each node's `execute` in order against a single view.
//!
//! No dependency tracking, no cross-node resource sharing, no
//! parallel execution. The trait is intentionally a one-method
//! `execute(rd, view)`: complex apps that need scheduling or
//! aliasing should compose nodes manually rather than waiting for
//! this graph to grow features.
