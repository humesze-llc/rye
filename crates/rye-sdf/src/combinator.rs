//! WGSL combinator helpers.
//!
//! Each combinator emits a named WGSL function that takes pre-evaluated
//! distance values and returns a combined distance. The Scene tree calls
//! the SDF sub-functions first, stores results in `let` bindings, then
//! passes them to the combinator function.
//!
//! All combinators are Space-agnostic: they operate on scalar distances
//! returned by `rye_distance`-based SDF functions, so they are correct
//! in E³, H³, and S³ without modification.

/// Emit a WGSL expression for the union (minimum) of two distances.
///
/// `da` and `db` must be WGSL `f32` expressions (ideally simple variable
/// names, not function calls, to avoid double evaluation).
pub fn union_expr(da: &str, db: &str) -> String {
    format!("min({da}, {db})")
}

/// Emit a WGSL expression for the intersection (maximum) of two distances.
pub fn intersection_expr(da: &str, db: &str) -> String {
    format!("max({da}, {db})")

/// Emit a WGSL expression for the difference A − B (carve B from A).

/// (Inigo Quilez polynomial blend).
///
/// `k` controls the blend radius (in Space distance units). The function
/// takes two pre-evaluated distances `(a: f32, b: f32)` and returns the
/// blended distance. Call it as `{name}(da, db)` in the scene body.
