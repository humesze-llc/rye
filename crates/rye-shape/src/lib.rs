//! `rye-shape` — the canonical geometric-primitive data model.
//!
//! Before this crate existed, [`rye_sdf::PrimitiveKind`](../rye_sdf/index.html)
//! (for rendering) and [`rye_physics::Collider`](../rye_physics/index.html)
//! (for collision) each defined their own parallel enum of shape types.
//! Adding a new shape — say a horosphere for H³ — meant touching both,
//! keeping their variant lists in sync by hand, and inventing new
//! conversion glue. This crate is the single source of truth they both
//! now alias to.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! - **One enum, all variants.** A `Shape` carries every shape either
//!   role needs. Variants that don't apply to a particular role — e.g.
//!   [`Shape::Polygon2D`] has no 3D SDF emission, [`Shape::Box3`] has
//!   no dedicated physics narrowphase today — are simply not
//!   implemented by that role's trait and return `None` / no-op.
//! - **Pose is extrinsic.** Most shapes (Sphere, Box3, the polytopes)
//!   are defined in a local "shape frame" and positioned by the
//!   caller's transform: the physics body's `position`+`orientation`,
//!   or an SDF scene node's transform. The one exception is
//!   [`Shape::Sphere`], which carries a `center` field so SDF scenes
//!   can place spheres without a transform combinator. Physics ignores
//!   that field (it always uses the body's position) — the physics
//!   sphere constructors set `center = Vec3::ZERO`.
//! - **No behavior.** This crate only defines the data. Rendering
//!   emission lives in `rye-sdf`; collision support lives in
//!   `rye-physics`. That keeps the dependency graph a tree (both
//!   consumers depend on `rye-shape`, `rye-shape` depends on nothing
//!   application-level).
